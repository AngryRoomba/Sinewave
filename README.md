# Sinewave Graphing Final Project
### Project Description
This project aims to take a .mp3 or .wav audio file and convert it into a series of sin wave graphs.
It will provide additional information about the processed file through a GUI.

### Usage Instructions
To use the program run the view.py file. Once the GUI appears click the upload audio file button and select the desired audio file. Once the desired file is selected click the plot given data button. 

After a few seconds various buttons should appear. To view the related graph simply click on the coresponding button. Additional data about the audio file can be found at the bottom of the GUI in a text box.

### Project Explanation
This program will serve as the final exam for our CS Problem Solving and Solutions class. It can serve as a tool to easily analyze recorded audio and extract information from it.
